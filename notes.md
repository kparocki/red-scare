# Our Ideas to Each Problem
*None*: (Daniel & Gaz) BFS to find shortest path in the graph where red nodes are removed (never remove and s, t)
*Few*: (Chris & Mie) Shortest path with weight 0 and 1 on edges in directed version (weight 1 to go into red node)
*Alternate*: (Gustav & Thomas) Make bipartite and BFS

*many*: longest path in acyclic graph
*some*: may be derived from many

## Questions Meeting 1
- Do source and target being red matter in which problems?
    - In *None* the color of s & t is not considered, in all other problem the color of s & t matters, i.e. if s is a red node it will count as a red node on the s,t-path.
- None, our solution to makes sense
- Alternate, our solution is on the right track
- Few, our solution is on the right track
- Our input makes sense so far :D
- Report is very short with explanations on 5-8 lines per problem - results should be a snippet of the full results (full results should follow a sensible format the is understandable - CSV of results makes sense)
- our idea for many does make sense - we should be able to reason about what kind of graphs makes sense -> acyclic does make sense, are there other types of instances (should not be the focus this week though!)
- TAs will validate putting in "enough effort" -> current effort is fine, goal is to apply what we learned so far in the course. We just need to make a reasonable attempt and make reasonable arguments for choices etc. Would like to see attempt of NP-Hardness reduction (we can do this together all of us, would be fun!)!
- We seem on the right track

## Questions Meeting 2
- ???

## Questions Meeting 3
- Ask about report structure and content etc.
